breaking:
  - Now requires additional frameworks:
    - "``ImageIO.framework``"
new:
  - Added ``setApplicationBadgeNumber:``
  - Added ``hasUserDisabledPushNotifications:``
  - Added ``openSettingsAppToThisAppsSettings``
  - "``teakRewardId`` is now included in the ``TeakOnReward`` event"
  - Now will warn via logs if ``unregisterForRemoteNotifications`` is called
bug:
  - "``teakRewardId`` in the ``TeakNotificationAppLaunch`` event is now a string (matches Android behavior, and fixes issues in Adobe Air)"
