new:
  - Support ``trackEvent`` for Adobe AIR
  - Added ``[Teak incrementEventWithActionId:forObjectTypeId:andObjectInstanceId:count:]``
bug:
  - Properly handle deep links with '?' or '#' in a URL path element
  - Fixed corner case bug where deep links would get evaluated before the host app was ready for them
