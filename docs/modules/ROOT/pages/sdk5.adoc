= Teak SDK 5

Teak SDK 5 will contain many changes, and break many things. We do not have a firm date or timeline for it, however as we integrate systems and make incremental changes that can be previewed.

== Previewing SDK 5 Behaviors

Starting in SDK 4.1.0 there is a way to preview SDK 5 behaviors.

To enable this, add the ``TeakSDK5Behaviors`` boolean key to your ``Info.plist``, and set it to ``true``.

.Info.plist
[source,xml]
----
  <key>TeakSDK5Behaviors</key>
  <true/>
