:page-pagination:

Welcome to the getting started guide for Teak in a native iOS Application.

In this guide, we will walk you through the process of setting up Teak in your iOS game. By the end of this guide you will be able to send a Push notification to your iOS device or simulator.

NOTE: If you are building your game with Unity, use our xref:unity::index.adoc[Unity SDK].

NOTE: Teak only supports single window applications or SwiftUI applications. Please mailto:team@teak.io[Contact Support] if you are using https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/scenes[Scenes] with Storyboards.

== Requirements

* [x] A Mac with https://developer.apple.com/xcode/[XCode, window=_blank] installed.

With that out of the way, let's get started.
